<h1>Rashene Dillon</h1>
<p>I am third-year Computer Science major and Management Studies minor 
    at the University of the West Indies. Aside from academics, I enjoy
    taking my dog for a walk, spending time with family and friends as well
    as exploring fine dining. Moreover, I get to embrace my creativity through
    makeup and fashion.
